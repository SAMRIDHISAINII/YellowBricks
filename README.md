Whether you are a beginner or an experienced practitioner, Yellow Bricks aims to make the process of model interpretation and evaluation more accessible and efficient.

## Why Yellow Bricks?

- **Interpretability**: Yellow Bricks offers a suite of visualizations to help you interpret the behavior of your models, making it easier to understand their decisions.

- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate your machine learning models with a variety of visual tools, including learning curves, feature importance plots, and more, to assess performance and identify areas for improvement.

- **Debugging**: Diagnose common issues and pitfalls in your models through visualization, allowing you to debug and optimize your machine learning pipelines effectively.

- **Educational**: Yellow Bricks is designed with education in mind, providing a valuable resource for learning machine learning concepts and techniques through visual aids and examples.

## Getting Started

1. Install Yellow Bricks using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install yellowbricks
    ```

2. Import Yellow Bricks in your Python script or Jupyter notebook:

    ```python
    import yellowbrick as yb
    ```

## Examples

Here are a few examples showcasing the capabilities of Yellow Bricks:

### Learning Curve

```python
from yellowbrick.model_selection import LearningCurve
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Load your dataset and split into training and testing sets
X, y = load_your_dataset()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a model (e.g., Logistic Regression)
model = LogisticRegression()

# Visualize the learning curve
visualizer = LearningCurve(model, scoring='accuracy')
visualizer.fit(X_train, y_train)
visualizer.show()
